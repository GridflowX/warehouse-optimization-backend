# Welcome to the Warehouse Optimization Backend Project!

**Warehouse Optimization Backend** is a cloud-native optimization platform that provides advanced algorithms for warehouse and guideway network optimization. The platform uses graph theory and mathematical optimization techniques to solve complex logistics problems, enabling efficient routing, package retrieval, and pallet optimization in modern warehouse environments.

This comprehensive solution addresses critical challenges in warehouse operations by providing optimized pathways, reducing operational costs, and improving overall efficiency through data-driven algorithmic approaches.

Warehouse Optimization Backend is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes (optional, for orchestrated deployment)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/warehouse-optimization-backend.git
   cd warehouse-optimization-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r GuideWayOptimization/requirements.txt
   pip install -r MainBackend/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the main backend:**
   ```bash
   cd MainBackend
   uvicorn server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. **Start optimization services:**
   ```bash
   # In separate terminals:
   cd GuideWayOptimization/backend && uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8001
   cd PackageAndRetrievalOptimization/backend && uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8002
   cd WtPalletsOptimization/backend && uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8003
   ```

## Scope

### In Scope

Warehouse Optimization Backend is intended to provide comprehensive optimization solutions for warehouse and logistics operations. As such, the project implements:

- **Guideway Network Optimization**: Graph-based algorithms for optimizing warehouse pathways and routing
- **Package and Retrieval Optimization**: Algorithms for efficient package placement and retrieval strategies
- **Weight and Pallets Optimization**: Advanced optimization for pallet placement and weight distribution
- **RESTful API Services**: Cloud-native microservices architecture with FastAPI
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes support for scalable deployment
- **Real-time Processing**: Concurrent algorithm execution with optimized performance

### Out of Scope

Warehouse Optimization Backend is designed to be used in a cloud native environment with other tools. The following specific functionality will therefore not be incorporated:

- **User Interface Components**: Frontend UI development (designed to work with external frontends)
- **Database Management**: Direct database administration (works with external data sources)
- **Physical Hardware Integration**: Direct integration with warehouse robotics or IoT devices

Warehouse Optimization Backend implements mathematical optimization algorithms, microservices architecture, and containerized deployment through Python, FastAPI, and Kubernetes. It will not cover frontend development, hardware-specific integrations, or proprietary warehouse management system features.

## Architecture Overview

The Warehouse Optimization Backend consists of four main microservices:

- **MainBackend**: Central API gateway and orchestration service
- **GuideWayOptimization**: Graph-based pathway optimization algorithms
- **PackageAndRetrievalOptimization**: Package placement and retrieval optimization
- **WtPalletsOptimization**: Weight distribution and pallet optimization

Each service is containerized and can be deployed independently or as part of the complete system using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
